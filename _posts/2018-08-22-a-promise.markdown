All I have ever done my entire life is compare myself with others. Whenever I look at someone, they become the benchmark by which I judge myself. This does not motivate me. It just drives me to do things I wouldn't normally do, to at least match this fictitious benchmark I have created for myself.

Sometimes I wonder whether this comparison really is a good thing. If I stop comparing myself with others, it is possible that I might never have the incentive to become better and better. On the other hand, it is also possible that I start flourishing when I have no one to compare myself to, since my focus is only on improving myself and what I am doing is not for competition, but for pleasure.

I don't have a solution to this problem for now, so I will just continue to explore all that I can do. It doesn't matter what path I take, all I want is to become better than I am now.

Some months ago I had tried to create a habit of learning something new - no matter how insignificant - every day, and then write about it on my blog. Unfortunately, this little experiment of mine had failed. But it is through failures that we learn, isn't it?

So I have decided once again, to try learning something new everyday, and then post about it over here.
