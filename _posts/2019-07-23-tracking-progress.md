Title: Progress
---

I find it difficult to do things unless I'm under a deadline or in a challenging situation. In light of this (and to build consistency), I have decided to start following some rules to get things into motion and form new habits.

### The Rules
1. 100 Day Challenge: I will be logging my experience daily at </progress/index.md> for the next 100 days, commiting to work at least 1 hour each day at a habit. This brings us to rule 2:
2. No More than 3 Habits at a Time
3. The Two Day Rule: It's okay to miss a day. However, I am NOT allowed to miss two days in a row.
Also, for each day I miss, I will have to add one more day to the remaining days to make up for it. 

My plan for the next 100 days:
* Habit 1: Study Everyday (Research Style)
    * What 'Research Style' means: Make notes, review lecture slides everyday, solve problems, draw your own conclusions on the text, try to explain concepts to your friends.

* Habit 2: Practice Deep Learning (Also Research Style)
    * Finish both the parts of the fastai course. 100 days translates to roughly 14 weeks, which is the amount of time the course requires from start to finish. I already have a head start of two weeks, so I can spend some time digging a little deeper.

* Habit 3: Running
    * I am currently at week 7 of the Couch-to-10K program. My plan is to complete this program in 8-10 weeks and then spend the remaining time improving my lap time.

* Other Productive Stuff
    * There is a lot more stuff that I want to work on, like reading, animating and skateboarding. I'll still do them whenever I feel like chilling and I have run out of anime and movies to watch.
