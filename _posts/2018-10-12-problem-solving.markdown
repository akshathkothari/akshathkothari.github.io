I have found a new way to look at and approach daily tasks that I am supposed to do. I'm going to look at everything as a problem that has a definite answer, but several possible solutions. I just have to find the one where I can have the most fun. This approach guarantees that I will reach the destination and also enjoy the journey.

Note that, this approach only works with tasks that I am _supposed_ to do. For everything else, I'll just improvise.
