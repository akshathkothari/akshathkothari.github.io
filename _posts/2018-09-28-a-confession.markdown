I'm not smart.
I'm not intelligent.
In order to reach where I am, I had to work hard, and sacrifice many things.
I had difficulty accepting this simple truth and had been lying to myself for a long time.
It had been bugging me, and it's time I now accept the truth.
I'm just like everyone else. I'm not special. I'm not the "chosen one". 
I'm hanging on by my fingernails here, and I can't rely on luck to keep me from falling anymore.
In order to realise my purpose and fulfill it, I must work hard.
That's all that matters.
