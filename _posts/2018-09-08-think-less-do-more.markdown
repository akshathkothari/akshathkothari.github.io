Many things have changed for me over the past couple of years, but one. The feeling of not knowing what I want to do still troubles me. Or at least it used to. Until now.

Maybe it is this feeling of ambiguity and uncertainty that will help me move forward. I feel scared whenever I think of the future. I think I just have to learn to embrace this feeling. 

I may not know what I will be doing a month or even a week from now, but one thing is certain: I don't want to spend the rest of my life like this. In order to realise my purpose of being here, I must change myself, one step at a time.

I spend a lot of time thinking about the future, even when I'm supposed to be working seriously. This results in me wasting most of my time and also decreases my productivity. So, recently, I thought of a simple solution (I actually remember reading about something similar in a book). 

I am going to fix a certain slot of time per week solely for thinking, nothing else. And whenever I'm working, and feel some distracting thoughts enter my mind, I will just tell myself to think about it during my thinking time.

This is kind of analogous to how the disk defragmentation tool works.
