Okay. So here's the thing. My "[problem solving][problem-solving-link]" approach didn't work out. Hell, I didn't even _think_ of approaching things that way since I wrote that post. I think that this is where my problem lies. I keep on planning things and thinking of what I should be doing without actually doing any of it.

There's only one thing left for me to do now. I have to stop giving in to the urges of instant gratification. This is how I spend most of my time these days. I keep on doing things in a shallow manner<sup>[1]</sup>, unconciously living the principle of least effort.

It really gets you down when things stop going your way. That's how I've been feeling since the past four months. I was overwhelmed by how well organised the people I met in college were, and how quickly life moves here; I still am. But no more. Like all those shounen protagonists, I too must stand back up each time that I fall. No matter how many obstacles come my way, and how hard life gets, I must face them all and keep moving forward.

So, what's next? Exams. And another shot at trying to learn something new everyday and posting about it here starting ~~today~~ tomorrow.
