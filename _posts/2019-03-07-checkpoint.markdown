This post serves as a checkpoint for me. If any action of mine causes me to turn into a person who lacks creativity and the capability for out of the box thinking, I should be able to read this post and “respawn” back into the person I am as of 22:29 hrs 7th March 2019 IST.

I have decided to make a big decision concerning one significant part of my life – formal education.

Ever since I was 11, I have thought of school education as being essential for personal development. And it was! I spent a lot of time trying to understand the logic behind things, always prioritising understanding concepts over rote memorisation. This way I was inspired by history, mathematics and the sciences. I developed an interest in reading and writing stories, poems and essays. I fell in love with French grammar and pondered over ancient Hindi dohé (couplets). I genuinely feel that the things I studied until tenth grade were responsible in shaping who I am today. Then I entered the eleventh grade, and everything went haywire.

Things stopped making sense to me. As I said before, I used to spend substantial amounts of time understanding the basics, but things seemed to be moving too fast in high school. Backlog upon backlog, I failed to cope up with the speed at which information was being fed to me and started scoring poorly on tests. But I still persevered. Even in the face of adversity, I refused to give up and stuck to my principles of learning. I barely managed to enter a university of my choice.

Over time, as I got older and wiser, I slowly started realising that it doesn’t matter how well I understand a subject, what ultimately matters (to others) will be my grade in that subject. I had great expectations from college, but it turned out to be the same as high school. And this made me very sad. I started to lose interest in my courses and started bunking classes, spending my time watching anime or sleeping. I ended up with a below average score (we are graded on a curve) in most of my courses in my first semester. This really, really pissed me off. Something needed to change, and fast. 

I started my second semester with a newfound determination. I planned to attend all classes, ace all tests, and most importantly – get an “in-depth” understanding of all subjects. And I have succeeded for the most part till now. Half of this semester has passed, and mid-semester exams start in the coming week. This brings me to the objective of writing this post.

It is difficult to get an in-depth understanding of any subject without spending a substantial amount of time reading concepts, solving problems, and analysing mistakes - time that I want to spend doing other things too - like designing motion graphics, contributing to open source software and socialising. I must start studying only as much is required for a good grade. Not more, not less. This style of learning things violates my principles, and I am afraid of turning into someone I will despise.

I feel that studying for grades, and not for learning, is linked to a loss in the ability of creative thinking. Fortunately, I only have to work like this temporarily, and then things will be back the way they are. If not, I can remain worry-free thanks to this checkpoint.
