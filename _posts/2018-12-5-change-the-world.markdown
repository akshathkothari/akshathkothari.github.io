Looking forward, here's a few things that I'm going to implement to get my life back on track:

1. Make a schedule and strictly adhere to it
2. Try to clock at least 12 hours of productivity per day
3. Keep a track of mistakes I make and ensure that they are not repeated
4. Get into shape
5. Work hard towards my one and only goal: to change the world. To make my existence matter.

I will not be deterred by unwanted thoughts this time. Each time I fall down, I will rise up even higher. Each time I lose my focus, I will not only regain it, but be even more disciplined than I was before. I will do everything it takes to be who I want to.

I don't ever want to feel satisfied. I want to keep working harder and harder until I am the best version of me - and then get better.

I can't sum up the feeling I have right now in words. It transcends anything I have ever felt before. But there is one thing I know for certain - I _will_ change the world.
