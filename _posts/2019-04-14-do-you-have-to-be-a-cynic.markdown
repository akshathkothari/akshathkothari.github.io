I don’t know about success but, being cynical will definitely allow you to see more clearly. Once you start viewing the world this way, peoples’ actions almost become predictable. And maybe this foresight is what enables one to be successful.

Think of it this way – if you were able to predict with very high accuracy how the people around you were going to act in the immediate future, wouldn’t you adjust your actions such that the outcome is always favourable for you?
