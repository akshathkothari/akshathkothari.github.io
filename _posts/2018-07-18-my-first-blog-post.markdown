Hi there! My name is Akshath Kothari, and I welcome you to my website. I used to write [here][blogger-link] before, but this is the only place I'll be posting from now on.

Why did I create this website? My primary motive for creating this blog is to keep track of everything I'm currently learning (mostly related to technology) or plan to learn in the future. Apart from that, you can expect me to (very) frequently rant here about trivial stuff. I love watching movies, reading books, listening to music, and I will probably be posting reviews and suggestions too. 

I will try to post here as frequently as possible! Here's to new beginnings!

I created this website using [Github Pages][ghpages-link] and [Jekyll][jekyll-link].
