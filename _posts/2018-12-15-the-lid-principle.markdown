Accountability. That's what I need in my life right now. The feeling that I am responsible for everything that happens with me. I can't change the past, and the future is full of uncertainty. Whatever I do, I must do _now_.

To reinforce this getting-things-done mindset, I have come up with the LID principle. LID stands for Learn, Implement, Document.

#### Learn
Life is all about learning. It's not about winning, being rich, or always getting what you want. It's about not giving up. It's about getting back up each time that you fall. And then falling again. If you don't fail, you don't learn. As simple as that. 

#### Implement
There's no point of learning anything if you don't use this knowledge. Start a project, find a gig, write a book, do something new with all that stuff you just learnt!

#### Document
Document your ideas, your point of view, your shortcomings and your bravery, and store them somewhere safe. Do this to keep a track of everything that you have learnt so far. This will serve as motivation when you feel like quitting and also act as a reminder of your purpose.

Until now, I wasn't really sure about why I was writing a blog. Henceforth, this website will act as a documentation of all the things that I learn from this moment onwards.

>I will not quit
