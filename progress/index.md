I find it difficult to do things unless I'm under a deadline or in a challenging situation. In light of this (and to build consistency), I have decided to start following some rules to get things into motion and form new habits.

### The Rules
1. 100 Day Challenge: I will log my experience regularly for the next 100 days.
2. No More than 3 Habits at a Time
3. The Two Day Rule: It's okay to miss a day. However, I am NOT allowed to miss two days in a row.
To make up for a day I miss, I will add an extra day to the remaining days. 
4. Use Procrastination to my advantage (Check out this amazing [article on Structured Procrastination](http://www.structuredprocrastination.com))

My plan for the next 100 days:
* Habit 1: Study (for College)
* Habit 2: Practice Deep Learning
* Habit 3: Exercise (Running and Pushups)
