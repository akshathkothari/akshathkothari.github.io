# Hi there.

My name is Akshath Kothari. I'm currently a sophomore at BITS, Pilani, pursuing dual degrees in Mathematics and Mechanical Engineering.

I am currently studying Deep Learning and using this website to document my data science journey. Check out my [blog](/blog/) for updates.

When I'm not studying, you can usually find me editing videos for college festivals, playing my guitar, skateboarding, reading books, running, watching anime, watching movies, playing video games, or coming up with random crazy ideas.

I upload my (bad) music covers to my [Youtube channel][youtube-link] and my original music to my [Soundcloud page][soundcloud-link].

You can check out my [Goodreads page][goodreads-link] to view the list of books that I've read in the past, I'm currently reading or plan to read in the future.

You can find a list of all the anime I've watched or plan to watch at [MyAnimeList][myanimelist-link].

If you're a gamer too, add me on [Steam][steam-link] or [PSN][psn-link].

You can find my Github page [here][github-link].

I vow to make a dent in the universe.
