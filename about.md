# Hi there.

My name is Akshath Kothari. I'm currently a first-year student at BITS, Pilani, pursuing an M.Sc. degree in Mathematics. I hope to be able to study for a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science as well by the end of this academic year. 

I like studying both science and liberal arts subjects. It is in my mission statement to improve myself and to learn as much as I can while minimising the time I spend doing other, non-productive things.

I'm deeply passionate about music. I mostly make covers of my favourite songs but I try to produce something original occasionally. You can check out my Soundcloud page [here][soundcloud-link] and my Youtube channel [here][youtube-link].

I also like to read lots of books. You can check out my Goodreads page [here][goodreads-link] to view the list of books that I've read in the past, I'm currently reading or plan to read in the future.

For entertainment, I love to watch Anime. You can find a list of all the anime I've watched or plan to watch [here][myanimelist-link]. From time to time, I also like to play computer games. To add me on steam, go [here][steam-link].

I also really like contributing towards open source projects. You can find my Github page [here][github-link].

About *sablerime* : When I was trying to find a handle to represent me online, I came up with many names, but each of them failed to meet one or more of the following criteria: it must mean something, it must have something to do with me, it should be unique, it should be easy to pronounce and easy to remember. That is when I came up with the name *sablerime*.
*sablerime* is a combination of two words: 'sable' and 'rime'. The word 'sable' is a synonym of 'black', which is my favourite colour. The word 'rime' is defined as the frost formed on cold surfaces by the rapid freezing of water vapour in cloud or fog. It is, literally, <a href = "/assets/images/i-am-so-cool.jpg" style="color:black; ">cool</a>.

As of today (22nd July 2018), I'm certainly not the person that I have projected myself to be in the above introduction. But I will strive to be that person. I will do whatever it takes. This is my promise to myself.
