# Hi there.

My name is Akshath Kothari. I'm currently a sophomore at BITS, Pilani, pursuing dual degrees in Mathematics and Mechanical Engineering.

When I'm not studying, you can usually find me editing videos for college festivals, playing my guitar, skateboarding, reading books, running, watching anime, watching movies, playing video games, or coming up with random crazy ideas.

My friends tell me I'm not an easy person to deal with, because I often lose sight of the little things in pursuit of 'the big picture'. I used to be proud of this behaviour for a long time until quite recently when I realised that this is not the kind of person I want to be. 

Dr. BrenÃ© Brown said in her TED talk, 
> "Because, by the time you're a social worker for 10 years, what you realize is that connection is why we're here. It's what gives purpose and meaning to our lives. This is what it's all about."

and I like to believe this too.

I am working to improve my skills, filter my thoughts and distill my ideas little by little, each day. I have a long road ahead of me, but I'm not alone. I am grateful to have a very supportive family and wonderful friends, each on their own journeys of self improvement. 

I do not know what I want to be when I grow up. I _do_ know however, that I want my existence to matter. I vow to make a dent in the universe.
