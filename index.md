# Hi there.

My name is Akshath Kothari. I'm currently a sophomore at BITS, Pilani, pursuing dual degrees in Mathematics and Mechanical Engineering.

I am passionate about Data Science, Machine Learning and Statistics.

I mostly blog here about things I find interesting. At present, I am studying deep learning and documenting my progress on this website.
